###### ToolTip Integration done in only Two Screens:-

1. These are **TooltipExample** available into the **src -> screens -> TooltipExample** & **ProfileDetails** is **src -> components -> ProfileDetails** .
2. I used Functional Component and Context Api for passing Props in **ProductDetails** page .
3. I also used **useContext** Hooks for receiving Props from parent page . It is betterment of ContextApi Consumer.
4. many other Screens are also availble but that are not used for ToolTip Integration.
