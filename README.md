# ToolTip Integration

This is sample Experiment project where small small experiment did and all are diffrentiated by **Branch name**

###### ToolTip Integration done in only Two Screens:-

1. These are **TooltipExample** available into the **src -> screens -> TooltipExample** & **ProfileDetails** is **src -> components -> ProfileDetails** .
2. I used Functional Component and useReducer for better State Management.
3. I alse used **useContext** Hooks for passing Props in **ProductDetails** page .
4. many other Screens are also availble but that are not used for ToolTip Integration.
